# Language Translator (English to French & Spanish)

This project is a GUI-based language translator that translates English sentences into French and Spanish using deep learning models. Developed as part of an internship at NullClass, it leverages TensorFlow, Keras, and Tkinter for a user-friendly experience.

## Features

*   Translates English to French and Spanish.
*   Intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
*   Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for accurate translations.
*   Supports text input and displays real-time translation.

## Technologies Used

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **GUI Framework:** Tkinter
*   **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow, Keras
*   **Libraries:** NumPy, JSON, `re`, `string`, Keras TextVectorization

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
